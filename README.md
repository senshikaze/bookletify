# Bookletify

![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/pages/plain-html/badges/master/build.svg)

A simple static site for a client-side conversion of a pdf to booklet layout.

## Depedencies

- [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/)
- [a11yana](https://github.com/alexandersandberg/a11yana)

## Known Issues

 - Some fancy pdfs result in rather weird conversions. Has something to do with the differing ways the size of a pdf can be defined.
